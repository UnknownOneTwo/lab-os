**Q:** Do you know what the current temps are?

**A:**
Unfortunately, the system status summary does not provide information on temperature readings. It only provides general system status, disk usage, uptime, and performance metrics. To get the current temperatures, you would need to run a command or query the monitoring tool you're using (if any).
