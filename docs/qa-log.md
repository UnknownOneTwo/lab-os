# Q: Any records on Levernes Lockett? census

## A:
I apologize for the confusion earlier! Based on the summaries provided, I didn't find any specific information about a person named Levernes Lockett in the 1830 United States Federal Census or any other census-related documents. The text appears to be a collection of random characters and doesn't seem to have any direct relevance to a person named Levernes Lockett.

If you're looking for information on Levernes Lockett, I'd suggest searching online databases such as ancestry.com, familysearch.org, or other genealogy websites that may have access to historical records. You can also try contacting local libraries, archives, or historical societies in the area where Levernes Lockett is believed to have lived to see if they have any records or information about him.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!
